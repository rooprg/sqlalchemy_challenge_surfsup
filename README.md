**SQLALCHEMY CHALLENGE**


**(1) Project Overview and Purpose:**

This exercise will result in a climate analysis, which can assist with trip planning. Precipitation and location information will be used to analyze potential locales for a vacation, while an app will be research weather conditions quickly.


**(2) Dataset Description:**

A single .sqlite file contains the precipitation and location (station) information. It is named "hawaii.sqlite".


**(3) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

The tables of the "hawaii.sqlite" file were reflected into SQLAchemy Object Relational Mapper.

The tables did not required cleaning for any missing or partially available information.


**(4) Data Visualization Techniques:**

The climate analysis resulted in two bar charts and a summary statistics table.

The app resulted in displaying responses to queries in a .html format, which could be viewed in a brower window (i.e., Google Chrome) at an address like http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/precipitation.


**(5) Results and Analysis:**

For the climate analysis-

(a) Plot of the precipitation analysis, the cumulative rainfall in inches for twelve (12) months between August 2016 and August 2017 was plotted with Date as the x-axis:

![Rainfall versus Time}(


**(6) Ethical Considerations:**

(Discuss any ethical considerations taken into account during the project, such as data privacy, bias, or fairness)


**(7) Instructions for Interacting with the Project:**

(Provide clear instructions on how to interact with the visualizations, such as how to run the code or access the visualizations)

(b) Instructor assistance via Office Hours (06-Jun-2024) regarding sqlite file location and availability for Climate App exercise


(c) Tutoring session (09-Jun-2024):

(i) Discussion on student's code needed for API Dynamic Route exercise for both (1) start date only and (2) start date + end date scenarios

(ii) Confirmation of np.ravel usage within Climate App code


(d) Several questions asked of Xpert Learning Assistant on the following topics:

(i) Using np.ravel for both correcting a histogram plot of the temperature data and applying to results to generate a one-dimensional (1D) list

(ii) Questions regarding availability of sqlite file for code (following from noted Instructor assistance above, #2)

(iii) Learning how to properly enter (1) start and (2) start + end dates in browser address for the Climate App exercise

(iv) Assistance with correcting syntax when errors where identified

(v) Other general code-related questions
