**SQLALCHEMY CHALLENGE**


**(1) Project Overview and Purpose:**

This exercise will result in a climate analysis, which can assist with trip planning. Precipitation and location information will be used to analyze potential locales for a vacation, while an app will be research weather conditions quickly.


**(2) Dataset Description:**

A single .sqlite file contains the precipitation and location (station) information. It is named "hawaii.sqlite".


**(3) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

The tables of the "hawaii.sqlite" file were reflected into SQLAchemy Object Relational Mapper.

The tables did not required cleaning for any missing or partially available information.


**(4) Data Visualization Techniques:**

(Detail the data visualization techniques used in the project, such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, etc. Explain why these techniques were chosen and how they help in understanding the data)


**(5) Results and Analysis:**

(Present the insights gained from the data visualization. Describe any patterns, trends, or relationships discovered in the data)


**(6) Ethical Considerations:**

(Discuss any ethical considerations taken into account during the project, such as data privacy, bias, or fairness)


**(7) Instructions for Interacting with the Project:**

(Provide clear instructions on how to interact with the visualizations, such as how to run the code or access the visualizations)

(b) Instructor assistance via Office Hours (06-Jun-2024) regarding sqlite file location and availability for Climate App exercise


(c) Tutoring session (09-Jun-2024):

(i) Discussion on student's code needed for API Dynamic Route exercise for both (1) start date only and (2) start date + end date scenarios

(ii) Confirmation of np.ravel usage within Climate App code


(d) Several questions asked of Xpert Learning Assistant on the following topics:

(i) Using np.ravel for both correcting a histogram plot of the temperature data and applying to results to generate a one-dimensional (1D) list

(ii) Questions regarding availability of sqlite file for code (following from noted Instructor assistance above, #2)

(iii) Learning how to properly enter (1) start and (2) start + end dates in browser address for the Climate App exercise

(iv) Assistance with correcting syntax when errors where identified

(v) Other general code-related questions
